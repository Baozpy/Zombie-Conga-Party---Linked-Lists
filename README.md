# Zombie-Conga-Party---Linked-Lists

create a Doubly-LinkedList Class and a Node Class

You are going to create a silly Zombie Conga Line using your Linked List.

Each node is going to store a Zombie in it. Zombies can be Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Magenta and Cyan.

Every turn you will randomly generate a Zombie object and an action. You will then perform that action using the Zombie object as the parameter for that action.
